    <h1>Spinach-Basic Pesto Pasta</h1>
    <img src="../img/pesto-pasta.jpg" alt="pesto-pasta">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This mild spinach-basil pesto tastes fresh, herbal, and nutty. It is super easy to make in a food processor or
        blender. Toss it with any kind of pasta and enjoy! This pesto also tastes delicious in sandwiches (mix with some
        mayo or cream cheese), on pizza (add a drizzle of olive oil), as a dip (mix with some sour cream), and as
        addition to salad vinaigrettes</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 oz (225 g) maccheroncini or any other pasta</li>
        <li>1 packed cup (40 g) baby spinach leaves</li>
        <li>¼ packed cup (10 g) fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>3-4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>¼ cup (25 g) walnuts, roughly chopped and toasted (raw are fine too, see note)</li>
        <li>¼ cup (20 g) grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>1 organic lemon, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring salted water to a boil, add pasta, and cook according to the package instructions, 8-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, combine spinach, basil, olive oil, walnuts, Parmesan, and salt in a food
            processor or blender. Blend until the mixture is well blended, pausing to scrape down the sides as
            necessary. If you prefer a chunkier pesto, stop processing while it still has some texture.</li>
        <li>Taste, and adjust salt if necessary. If you feel it lacks zing, add a squeeze of lemon juice or some grated
            lemon zest.</li>
        <li>Drain pasta, but reserve some of the pasta water. Toss pasta with the pesto and add some of the pasta water,
            if needed. Serve with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Notes</h3>
    <p> <strong>Walnuts:</strong>While using raw walnuts is totally fine, toasting them for 10 minutes in a 350°F
        preheated oven takes the pesto to the next level.</p>
    <p><strong>Storage:</strong> Store leftover pesto, if there is any, in a covered container in the refrigerator for
        several days. To prevent the pesto from changing color during storage due to oxidation, place the pesto in a
        container, flatten its surface, and pour a thin layer of oil over the top of the pesto. Cover with a lid. It
        also freezes well.</p>
